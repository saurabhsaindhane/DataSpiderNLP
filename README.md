# DataSpiderNLP

DataSpiderNLP is a comprehensive project focused on data extraction and natural language processing (NLP). The project includes various scripts, data files, and documentation aimed at analyzing and processing text data. It leverages Python and popular libraries to demonstrate practical applications of NLP techniques.

## Project Structure

- **MasterDictionary/**: Directory containing master dictionary files.
- **StopWords/**: Directory containing stop words files.
- **Input.xlsx**: Input data in Excel format.
- **NLP.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with the main analysis and code.
- **nlp.py**: Python script for NLP processing.
- **Objective.docx**: Document outlining the objectives of the project.
- **Output Data.xlsx**: Excel file with the output data from the analysis.
- **Readme.md**: Markdown file with the project description and instructions.
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python packages required to run the project.
